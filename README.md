# Convert SQL Server DB to SQLite DB #

Liron Levi made a great converter over on CodeProject at [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/convsqlservertosqlite.aspx](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/convsqlservertosqlite.aspx)

This project was placed in the public domain, so I've forked it on GitHub and made the following changes to the 1.16 version:

1. Converted to VS2010 solution/project format
2. Added support for SQL Server 2008 datetime2 format.

There's probably other minor additions to be made to the project, but those two changes got me what I needed for now.

Thanks Liron!
